I have developed a code to facilitate retrofit decision-making for handling large data. This code allows for the analysis of various building types,
including commercial and residential properties, to establish a robust decision-making process for companies and municipalities seeking 
to retrofit a district with minimal emissions.

Building data file:
This data file contains information about the buildings, including geometry, U-values of walls and windows for both old and new scenarios, 
heat pump details, areas of photovoltaics (PVs) facing different angles, and more.

Confiq file:
This file contains data regarding the emissions from the retrofit components of the buildings.

EPW file:
The user should upload this file to specify the location of the city.

Results:
The results file includes several folders containing heat map graphs and data for all possible scenarios for 
retrofitting of the buildings in the district, as well as the total emissions for the district.
